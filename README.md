## Introduction

This small guide explains how to stay **safe** on the internet. I made this because of my bad experience with being online and meeting all the wrong people resulting in me getting doxed.

This sort tutorial will be separated in different rules, going from easy to implement to more inconvenient rules to follow.

Also, do **not** take this tutorial as the golden standard, there are far better tutorials out there with a quick google search on how to stay safe, this document covers what **I believe** everyone should follow at the very least to stay safe online.

### Rule number one: Use strong passwords

This is quite easy to do but it's essential to not lose your accounts, a strong password must have the following:

* It must be at the very least 25 characters long
* It must have lower and capital case letters, alongside special characters and numbers
* It must not be easily guessable

*Note: This is a no brainer but **<u>do not reuse passwords</u>**

### Rule number two: Use a password manager

There is no way you can remember all of your passwords that you use online, to solve this problem you will need a password manager. There are multiple password managers out thre but I personally use KeePassXC, it doesn't require an internet connection and it's safe to use. 

I strongly recommend to have a **strong password** for you password manager as mentioned in [rule number one](#rule-number-one:-use-strong-passwords). Also, there is a chance that you might forget your master password so please **keep a backup of the master password and a copy of the encrypted passwords file**.

### Rule number three: Use multiple aliases

For every platform, either it's discord or github, use different aliases, and do not share those aliases / accounts to random people. I had to change the names of multiple accounts I had or even delete them after I have been doxed so no one can link my accounts to each other which is something a lot of people do.

### Rule number four: Do not share personal details

Another no brainer tip but I mean that you should not share anything, that includes:

* How you look
* Your age
* Your birthday
* Your job / school
* Name
* Country of origin
* Gender
* Sexual orientation

There are way more things that you should not share with anyone but I think you get the point, with that said it's not the end of the world if you share some personal information to other people but avoid it as much as you can.

### Rule number five: Do not make people angry

If you make people mad over the internet they will want to hurt you so to avoid that don't make people angry, my personal experience with being doxed was because I told someone to fuck off, that resulted in them spending the next 6 months trying to find everything what they could about me and waiting for me to slip up which eventually happened. So to keep it sort, **you make yourself less of a target** if you don't anger anyone on the internet.

### Rule number six: Think before you send something

**Think** before you send a screenshot to a public server or a stranger over the internet, I have personally witnessed someone being doxed (their house address / name / age / nationality) over images they send to a discord server of their home interior and other stuff.

This wouldn't have happened if they **thought** if they should send an image or personal information over the internet.
